The program is divided into 3 main modules:
1) Learner
2) Validator
3) Predictor

with some helper modules that contains helper functions. The entrance of the program is through main.py file


To run the program, type: " python main.py [train_data_set] [validation_data_set] [test_data_set] "

The program first use train data set to build the decision tree, and use the tree for validation set to calculate the
prediction accuracy, and finally, the tree is passed to test set for prediction. The predicted value is written to file
